# Instanews

For this project, I utilized:
HTML
SASS
JQuery (including plugins)
Webpack
AJAX

By using these technologies, I was able to further understand how these frameworks operate.

#Experience
As one of my first time using JQuery, this project was a great opportunity for me to learn how to write JQuery code and connect it with my other documents. I also learned how to call an API as well.
